### Free Edition
**`getgenv().ignoreGameCheck`** controls whether the script detects supported games. When set to:
- **`false`**: Only runs features for the specific supported game
- **`true`**: Attempts to run universal features across any game

```lua
getgenv().ignoreGameCheck = false
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://luau.tech/build"))()
```
