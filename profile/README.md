## Script 📜
Use Starry today using the script below ✨
### Free Edition
**`slipGameCheck`** controls whether the script detects supported games. When set to:
- **`false`**: Only runs features for the specific supported game
- **`true`**: Attempts to run universal features across any game

```lua
-- Starry's Stable Ed. | User Build | Using Latest Ver. --

skipGameCheck = false; -- Change to "true" when desiring Universal-only!

local project = "luau.tech";
loadstring(request({
  Url = `https://{project}/build`,
  Method = "GET"
}).Body)();

-- Purchase Premium & skip keys @ luau.tech/pricing --
